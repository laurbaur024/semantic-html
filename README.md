# Semantic HTML Homework

## Activity

- This repo contains an html file that has been changed from having non-semantic tags to semantic tags.
- This has helped the page become more accessible and optimized for the search engine.

## User Instructions

- Look in the index.html file to see the semantic tags contained within.
- Look in the style.css file to see the tags that were updated to keep the style on the page accurate.

## Screenshot

- Here is a screenshot of the working webpage.
